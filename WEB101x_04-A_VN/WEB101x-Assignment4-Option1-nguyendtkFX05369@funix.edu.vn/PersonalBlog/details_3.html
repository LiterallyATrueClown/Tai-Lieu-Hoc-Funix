<p>I didn't think that cream cheese pound cake is delicious, but may be. . . i was wrong.
One day, I am buying recipes for my next cake, I saw a baker is bringing a very beautiful cake so I want to try its tastes, Ohmygosh it tastes so GOOD then I asked the baker to buy more for my husband
When my husband tastes it, he has an dizzy and he said that it tastes really good so I go to my kitchen and bake a cream cheese pound cake.
The cake is being cooked then I call my friends come to my home to try it.
And we have a pajamas party after we have eatten the cake.</p>
